# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

   - assets/images/novafrente.jpg
   - assets/images/logosalao.png

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

    - family: MyFlutterApp
      fonts:
